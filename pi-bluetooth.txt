To pair a Pi with the HC05 chip, run the following:

$ bluetoothctl      # Start bluetooth agent manager
$ power on          # Power on bluetooth
$ pairable on       # Enable pairing
$ agent on          # Turn on pairing agent
$ scan on           # Scan for devices, wait ~30 seconds
$ scan off          # Stop the scanning after 30 seconds

$ pair 98:D3:32:11:67:C2        # Pair with the HC05 chip
$ trust 98:D3:32:11:67:C2       # Trust the chip
$ quit                          # Quit the BT manager

Once this is done, confirm that pairing is successful by manually connecting to
the HC05 chip by running the following:

$ sudo rfcomm connect hci0 98:D3:32:11:67:C2

If connection is successful, then the pairing works. You can Ctrl-C to close
this connection. You can now connect to the HC05 chip using a python script.
